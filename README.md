Dokuwiki plugin to integrate lightbox for all images on wiki pages.

CHANGES by Elan Ruusam√§e:

2008-08-08 - release that actually works (again)
2009-03-12 - JavaScript compression support; Konqueror support
2011-11-24 - Added code to github; no other changes

2012-01-03 - ported to use jquery-lightbox (http://krewenki.github.com/jquery-lightbox/ [1])
             This version requires DokuWiki Angua release (2011-11-10) due jQuery dependency.
             And older lightbox plugin versions do not work on Angua due the same reason :)
